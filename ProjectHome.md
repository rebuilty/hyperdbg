HyperDbg is a kernel debugger that leverages _hardware-assisted virtualization_. More precisely, HyperDbg is based on a _minimalistic hypervisor that is installed while the system runs_. Compared to traditional kernel debuggers (e.g., `WinDbg`, `SoftIce`, `Rasta R0 Debugger`) HyperDbg is completely transparent to the kernel and can be used to debug kernel code without the need of serial (or USB) cables. For example, HyperDbg allows to _single step the execution of the kernel_, even when the kernel is executing exception and interrupt handlers. Compared to traditional virtual machine based debuggers (e.g., the VMware builtin debugger), HyperDbg does not require the kernel to be run as a guest of a virtual machine, although it is as powerful.
